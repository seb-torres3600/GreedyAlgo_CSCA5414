# Dynamic Programming : Greedy Algo

## Author: Sebastian Torres

This course covers basic algorithm design techniques such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. It concludes with a brief introduction to intractability (NP-completeness) and using linear/integer programming solvers for solving optimization problems. We will also cover some advanced topics in data structures.

**Week 1** - Divide and Conquer Algorithms
**Week 2** - Dynamic Programming Algorithms
**Week 3** - Greedy Algorithms
**Week 4** - Intractability and Supplement on Qunatum Computing
